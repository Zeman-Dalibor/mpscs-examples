# Examples of C# Base Language Usage

This repository contains simple examples of usage of
[the C# base langauage](https://github.com/vaclav/mpscs).

List of implemented example programs:
- **Hello World**. The well-known program of printing a message to the world.
- **Quicksort**. A program implementing the popular Quicksort algorithm. It demonstrates mainly
coding of expressions.
- **Sort Comparison**. A program checking whether algorithms Bubble Sort and Selection Sort return
the same results. This example demonstrates mainly that a code split into multiple files can be
implemented in the C# base language.
- **Word Count**. A program counting words in a file. This demonstrates primarily that the C#
standard library can be properly used.

There is also one implemented example DSL, called **Calculator**. It is inspired by a similar
example DSL for the Base Language (i.e. the Java base language bundled as the main base language
in MPS). It is a very simple DSL allowing creation of parameterized expressions. Even though
it is so simple, it fully demonstrates the possibility of using our C# base language for
implementation of DSLs.
